# Linear Regression

## Description
This is sample linear regression with sample equation and scikit learn library

### Algorithm 
First we split our data base train and test set 

#### Scikit learn 
For use scikit learn , import library and call LinearRegression after we use fit to send x_train and y_train
after for use test set to use it in the predict 

#### Simple Equations
In this algorithm we use theta and we have this formula theta =(inverse of this  X.T.dot(X)).dot(x.T).dot(Y)
theta has two value first for intercept and second is for slope (a normal equation y = mx + b )
